The diffusion of ions through solid materials is a fundamental physical process that underpins applications such as lithium-ion batteries, fuel cells, and chemical sensors. One common technique for studying atomic scale diffusion processes in solids is [molecular dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_dynamics) simulation, which can be used to directly calculate macroscopic transport coefficients, i.e. diffusion coefficients and ionic conductivities, and also to examine the detailed atomic scale mechanisms of ionic transport. While molecular dynamics simulations, in principle, provides a description of all atomic scale dynamical processes that occur on a simulation timescale, analysing the resulting raw data to extract quantitative data about diffusion mechanisms can be challenging. 

One approach to obtain mechanistic information from a molecular dynamics simulation is to spatially discretise the atomic trajectories by projecting from a set of three dimensional continuous coordinates onto a set of discrete "sites". This approach is founded on the idea that in many solids, diffusion proceeds by ions undergoing a sequence of "jumps" between local potential energy minima.
